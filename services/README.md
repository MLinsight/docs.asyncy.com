# Services

Asyncy is a **microservice choreography platform** of highly specialised services that are independently scalable and deployable. Asyncy supports the [Open Microservice Guide](https://microservice.guide)'s implementation of microservice. These services are platform-agnostic and vendor-neutral.

You can find hundreds of free and paid services in our Asyncy Hub or build your own service. All services must be submitted to the Asyncy Hub to work on Asyncy.

## Asyncy Hub

The [Asyncy Hub](https://hub.asyncy.com) is a registry for services that can run in Asyncy.

## Open Microservice Guide

Asyncy proudly supports the **Microservice.Guide** open standard for containerizing microservices using Docker. The documentation for this standard is found at [http://microservice.guide](https://microservice.guide).
