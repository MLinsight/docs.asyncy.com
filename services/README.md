## Community Services

The [Asyncy Hub](https://hub.asyncy.com) is a registry for community services that are free or subscription based.
This registry acts as the Asyncy library when compared to traditional programming languages.

## Containers via Docker

Asyncy proudly supports the **Microservice.Guide** open standard for containerizing microservices using Docker. The documentation for this standard is found at [http://microservice.guide](https://microservice.guide).


## Stories

Developers may submit a set of Storyscript's that act as a reusable service.
This is handled through the Asyncy Hub.
